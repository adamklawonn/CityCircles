* Library for fulltext search integration with active record.
* Build to support multiple search Backends
* acts_as_searchable Successor


== Pre-requisites
A working Hyper Estraier instance, setup instructions:

* Setup Instructions: http://pragmatig.wordpress.com/2008/05/06/getting-started-with-acts_as_searchable-on-ubuntu/
* In-depth Documentation: http://hyperestraier.sourceforge.net/nguide-en.html
* rake search:node:create MODEL=User RAILS_ENV=production - for every model/environment you use


== Install
As Rails plugin(recommended <-> rake tasks/cap recipes):
  script/plugin install git://github.com/grosser/search_do.git
Or as Gem:
  sudo gem install searh_do

install will_paginate to use "paginate_by_fulltext_search" (Instruction: http://github.com/mislav/will_paginate/wikis/installation)


== Usage

  #MODEL
  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_searchable(
      #fields the will be found in fulltext search
      :searchable_fields => [:name,:website,:city,:about],
      #fields used for attribute search/ordering
      :attributes => {:name=>nil,:city=>nil,:country=>nil,:age=>nil}
    )
    attr_accessor :html_snippet #add this to get html snippets on your results (see below)
  end

  #SEARCH
  Users who:
   - contain 'hello' in any of their searchable fields
   - whose website attribute contains 'www' (contains search for strings)
   - whose age is 1 (exact match for numbers/dates)
   - sorted by age ASC
  @results = User.paginate_by_fulltext_search('hello',:attributes=>{:website=>'www',:age=>1},:order=>'age ASC',:page=>1,:per_page=>20)

  (Same can be done without pagination: User.fulltext_search)

  #SNIPPETS
  Each record found with a fulltext-search (not a attribute-only search) contains a snippet
  of the surrounding where the phrase was found.

  User.fulltext_search('hello') => user.html_snippet == "id like to say <b>hello</b> to my fellow students"

  NOTE: html_snippet will not contain HTML except for the <b>, so there is no need to escape it.
