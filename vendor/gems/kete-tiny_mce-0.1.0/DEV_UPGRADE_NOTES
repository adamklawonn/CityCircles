How to update the bundled TinyMCE
---------------------------------

1) Download TinyMCE, and extract it to your Desktop
2) Delete the copy of TinyMCE in the plugin at lib/tiny_mce/assets/tiny_mce (this ensures old/removed files are deleted)
3) Copy the source files of TinyMCE (not documentation) to lib/tiny_mce/assets/tiny_mce
4) Update the CHANGELOG_PLUGIN to say what you upgraded from, what you upgraded to, and your name
5) Update CHANGELOG_TINYMCE (download and overwrite the file with http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/js/tinymce/changelog.txt)
6) Update the 'Bundled TinyMCE version' value at the bottom of README.rdoc
7) Update lib/tiny_mce/valid_tinymce_options.yml with any new options, or remove old ones, as described in the tinymce changelog
8) Commit, push, and send pull request to http://github.com/kete/tiny_mce
