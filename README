== Welcome to City Circles

CityCircles is a collaborative platform where users and journalists work together to create and share information around each light-rail stop. That includes news, events, promotions, classifieds and social networking. There's even a community improvement tool that helps our users create, join and accomplish projects that make the city a better place for everyone. Think of us as the context that makes your urban experience more meaningful, your digital sidekick in the city.

The City Circles code can be used to emphasize any geographic location and allow users to collaboratively contribute content to that location.

== Developers

The code is still under development and changes will occur quite frequently. If something isn't working please add an issue and we'll investigate. Some things are simply not working and will be addressed as quickly as possible. There is currently no test suite...if you fancy writing test suites by all means have a go at it. All feedback is welcome. 

== Installation and Setup

City Circles is a Ruby on Rails application. As such, you'll need a recent version (2.3.5+):

  gem install rails -v 2.3.5
  
City Circles strives to allow you to use whichever database suits your needs. You'll need a recent version of the MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc. drivers:

  gem install mysql 
  
  or
  
  gem install postgres
  
  or 
  
  gem install [your database driver]
  
  
You should then be able to run rake:gems:install which should install all of the other dependencies:

  rake gems:install

Search is performed using the Xapian project.

You can setup a cron job to rebuild the index for posts every minute under the web applications owner's crontab:

  */1 * * * * RAILS_ENV=production /opt/ruby-enterprise/bin/rake -f /[path-to-project-root]/Rakefile xapian:rebuild_index models="Post"
